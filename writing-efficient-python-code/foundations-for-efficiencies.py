A taste of things to come
In this exercise, you'll explore both the Non-Pythonic and Pythonic ways of looping over a list.

names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

Suppose you wanted to collect the names in the above list that have six letters or more. In other programming languages, the typical
approach is to create an index variable (i), use i to iterate over the list, and use an if statement to collect the names with six
letters or more:

i = 0
new_list= []
while i < len(names):
    if len(names[i]) >= 6:
        new_list.append(names[i])
    i += 1

Let's explore some more Pythonic ways of doing this.

Instructions:
1.) Print the list, new_list, that was created using a Non-Pythonic approach.
2.) A more Pythonic approach would loop over the contents of names, rather than using an index variable. Print better_list.
3.) The best Pythonic way of doing this is by using list comprehension. Print best_list.

    Great work! Don't get too caught up in the coding concepts just yet (you'll practice using lists, for loops, and list

    you to write cleaner and more efficient code.

    """
    Built-in practice: range()
    In this exercise, you will practice using Python's built-in function range(). Remember that you can use range() in a
    few different ways:

    1) Create a sequence of numbers from 0 to a stop value (which is exclusive). This is useful when you want to create a simple
    sequence of numbers starting at zero:

            range(stop)

            # Example
            list(range(11))

            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    2) Create a sequence of numbers from a start value to a stop value (which is exclusive) with a step size. This is useful when
    you want to create a sequence of numbers that increments by some value other than one. For example, a list of even numbers:

            range(start, stop, step)

            # Example
            list(range(2,11,2))

            [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    Instructions:
    + Create a range object that starts at zero and ends at five. Only use a stop argument.
    + Convert the nums variable into a list called nums_list.
    + Create a new list called nums_list2 that starts at one, ends at eleven, and increments by two by unpacking a range object using
      the star character (*).
    """
    # Create a range object that goes from 0 to 5
    nums = range(6)
    print(type(nums))

    # Convert nums to a list
    nums_list = list(nums)
    print(nums_list)

    # Create a new list of odd numbers from 1 to 11 by unpacking a range object
    nums_list2 = [*range(1, 12, 2)]
    print(nums_list2)

    """
    Nicely done! Notice that using Python's range() function allows you to create a range object of numbers without explicitly 
    typing them out. You can convert the range object into a list by using the list() function or by unpacking it into a list using 
    the star character (*). Cool!
    """


def built_in_practice_enumerate():
    """
    Built-in practice: enumerate()
    In this exercise, you'll practice using Python's built-in function enumerate(). This function is useful for obtaining an indexed list. For example, suppose you had a list of people that arrived at a party you are hosting. The list is ordered by arrival (Jerry was the first to arrive, followed by Kramer, etc.):

            names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

    If you wanted to attach an index representing a person's arrival order, you could use the following for loop:

            indexed_names = []
            for i in range(len(names)):
                index_name = (i, names[i])

            [(0,'Jerry'),(1,'Kramer'),(2,'Elaine'),(3,'George'),(4,'Newman')]

    But, that's not the most efficient solution. Let's explore how to use enumerate() to make this more efficient.

    Instructions:
    + Instead of using for i in range(len(names)), update the for loop to use i as the index variable and name as the iterator
      variable and use enumerate().
    + Rewrite the previous for loop using enumerate() and list comprehension to create a new list, indexed_names_comp.
    + Create another list (indexed_names_unpack) by using the star character (*) to unpack the enumerate object created from
      using enumerate() on names. This time, start the index for enumerate() at one instead of zero.

    indexed_names = []
    for i, name in enumerate(names):
        index_name = (i, name)

    Awesome! Using Python's built-in enumerate() function allows you to create an index for each item in the object you give it. 
    You can use list comprehension, or even unpack the enumerate object directly into a list, to write a nice simple one-liner.
    """


def built_in_practice_map():
    """
    Built-in practice: map()
    In this exercise, you'll practice using Python's built-in map() function to apply a function to every element of an object.
    Let's look at a list of party guests:

            names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

    Suppose you wanted to create a new list (called names_uppercase) that converted all the letters in each name to uppercase.
    You could accomplish this with the below for loop:

            names_uppercase = []

            for name in names:
              names_uppercase.append(name.upper())

            ['JERRY', 'KRAMER', 'ELAINE', 'GEORGE', 'NEWMAN']

    + Use map() and the method str.upper() to convert each name in the list names to uppercase. Save this to the variable names_map.
    + Print the data type of names_map.

    party, and so on and so forth.
