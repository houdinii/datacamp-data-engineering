--------------------------------------------------

Getting Started With csvkit:
============================

What is csvkit?
csvkit:
- is a suite of command-line tools
- is developed in Python by Wireservice
- offers data processing and cleaning capabilities on CSV files
- has data conversion, processing, and cleaning capabilities that rival Python, R, and SQL

How do you install csvkit?
Install csvkit using Python package manager pip:
    pip install csvkit
Upgrade csvkit with:
    pip install --upgrade csvkit


in2csv: converting files to CSV
===============================

Command-line documentation:
    in2csv --help/-h

Syntax:
    in2csv SpotifyData.xlsx > SpotifyData.csv

in2csv SpotifyData.xlsx prints the first sheet in Excel to console and DOES NOT SAVE
> SpotifyData.csv redirects the output and saves it as a new file, SpotifyData.csv.

Use --names or -n option to print all sheet names.
Use --sheet option followed by the sheet (in quotes) to specify sheet to be converted.

in2csv does not print logs to console so you need to do an ls 'sanity check'


csvlook: Data Preview on the Command Line
=========================================

csvlook: renders a CSV to the command line in a Markdown-compatible, fixed-width format.

Documentation:
    csvlook -h

Syntax:
    svlook Spotify_Popularity.csv

Output:
| track_id              | popularity |
|-----------------------|------------|
|asdfea561aef516afa6sdfe|          7 |
|faefaf561aef516afa6sdfe|          7 |
|561dae4g5aef516afa6sdfe|          7 |
|sefea56a1aef516afa6sdfe|          7 |
|df4fea561aef516afa6sdfe|          7 |


csvstat: Descriptive Stats on CSV Data Files
============================================

Documentation:
    csvstat -h

Syntax:
    csvstat Spotify_Popularity.csv

Output:
    1. "track_id"

        Type of data:           Text
        Contains null values:   False
        Unique values:          24
        Longest value:          22 characters
        Most common values:     asdfea561aef516afa6sdfe (1x)
                                sefea56a1aef516afa6sdfe (1x)

Filtering Data Using csvkit:
============================

What does it mean to filter data?
We can create a subset of the original data file by:
    1. Filtering the data by column
    2. Filtering the data by row
csvcut: filters data using column name or position.
csvgrep: filters data by row value through exact match, pattern matching, or even regex.


csvcut: Filtering Data By Column:
=================================

Documentation:
    csvcut -h

csvcut --names/-n option prints all column names in input file.

-c option: -c {col_nums separated by comma or col_names IN QUOTES separated by comma} {filename} - returns column indicated


csvgrep: Filtering Data by Row Value:
=====================================

csvgrep:
+ Filters by row using exact match or regex fuzzy matching
+ must be paired with one of these options:
    + -m: followed by the exact row value to filter WITHOUT QUOTES
    + -r: followed by a regex pattern
    + -f: followed by the path to a file

Documentation:
    csvgrep -h

Customer:
Find in Spotify_Popularity.csv where track_id = asdfea561aef516afa6sdfe

By Column Name:
    csvgrep -c "track_id" -m asdfea561aef516afa6sdfe Spotify_Popularity.csv

By Column Number:
    csvgrep -c 1 -m asdfea561aef516afa6sdfe Spotify_Popularity.csv


Stacking data and chaining commands with csvkit:
================================================

csvstack: Stacking Multiple CSV Files
Stacks up the ros from two or more CSV files.

Documentation:
+ csvstack -h

Stack two similar files (same columns), Spotify_Rank6.csv and Spotify_Rank7.csv into one file.

Syntax:
    csvstack Spotify_Rank6.csv Spotify_Rank7.csv > Spotify_AllRanks.csv
                     Typically Followed By:
                  csvlook Spotify_AllRanks.csv

    -g GROUPS - comma sepparated list to use as grouping factors (label for each file)
    -n GROUP_NAME - A name for the grouping column

Customer:
    csvstack -g "Rank6", "Rank7" Spotify_Rank6.csv Spotify_Rank7.csv > Spotify_AllRanks.csv


Chaining Command-Line Commands:
===============================

;  - links commands together and runs sequentially
    csvlook SpotifyData_All.csv; csvstat SpotifyData_All.csv

&& - links commands together, but only runs the 2nd command if the 1st succeeds
     csvlook SpotifyData_All.csv && csvstat SpotifyData_All.csv

>  - re-direts the output from the 1st command to the location indicated by the 2nd command.
     in2csv SpotifyData.xlsx > SpotifyData.csv

|  - uses the output of the 1st command as input to the 2nd
        Customer: Output of the 1st command as input to the 2nd
            csvcut -c "track_id","danceability" Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv

        A Better Way: Re-format csvcut's output by piping the output as input to csvlook:
            csvcut -c "track_id","danceability" Spotify_Popularity.csv | csvlook
