More On Decorators - Now that you understand how decorators work under the hood, this chapter gives you a bunch of real-world examples 
of when and how you would write decorators in your own code. You will also learn advanced decorator concepts like how to preserve the 
metadata of your decorated functions and how to write decorators that take arguments.

Real-world Examples:

- The timer() decorator runs the decorated function and then prints how long it took for the function to run.
    - All decorators have fairly-similar doctrings because they return a single function.
    - wrapper() takes any number of positional and kw args so that it can be used to decorate any function.
    - The first thing the new func will do is record the time that it was called with the time() function.
    - Then wrapper() gets the result of calling the decorated function.
    - After calling decorated function, wrapper() checks the time again and prints time elapsed.
    - Once we've done that, we need to return the value that the decorated function calculated

Memoizing - The process of storing the results of a function so that the next time the function is 
called with the same arguments, you can just look up the answer. (I.e. cacheing)

- Start by setting up a dictionary that will map arguments to results
- Then we create wrapper() to be the new decorated function that this decorator returns.
- When the new function gets called, we check to see if we've seen these args before.
    - If we haven't, send them to the decorated function and store result in the cache dictionary.
        - Now we can look up the return value quickly in a dictionary of results.
    - If we have, simply return cache[(args, kwargs)] since it's already in the dictionary, negating the need to rerun func().

When to use decorators: When adding common cbehavior to multiple functions

Decorators and metadata:

When we use decorators, they obscure a function's metadata (like __doc__ and __name__). Thankfully, the module wraps() in functools
provides us with a way to pass this metadata along. It also gives us easy access to the original undecorated function via the 
__wrapped__ attribute.
