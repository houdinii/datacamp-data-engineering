Python on the Command Line:
============================

Documentation:

    >>>
    ...
    -V , --version
        Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.

    /anaconda3/bin/python = Anaconda

To activate the python console, type: python (or python3... you know this stuff), to exit, type: exit()

Python script execution on the command line:
Method 1:
    + Create a .py file using a text editor on the command line (e.g. nano, Vim, Emacs)
Method 2:
    + Create a .py file by echo-ing the python syntax into a .py file, instantiating the file in the same step.
        echo "print('hello world')" > hello_world.py
    + Sanity Check:
        cat hello_world.py
    + Execution:
        python hello_world.py

| | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun, mon, tue, wed ...
| | | | |
* * * * * command to be executed

Customer:
